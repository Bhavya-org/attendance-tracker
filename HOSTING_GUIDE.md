### 🎯 CURRENT STATUS: You're Almost There! 

Based on your screenshots, everything is set up correctly:

### 📋 Next Steps:

**Option A: Wait for Automatic Build (Recommended)**
1. Go to your repository's **"Actions"** tab
2. Look for a workflow run (should appear automatically)
3. Wait for it to complete (green checkmark)
4. Your site will be live at: `https://bhavya-org.github.io/attendance-tracker`

**Option B: Manual Build (If no automatic build)**
1. In the "Actions" tab, click **"Skip this and set up a workflow yourself"**
2. Delete everything in the editor
3. Copy and paste this code:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: '.'
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

4. Click **"Commit changes"**
5. This will trigger the build automatically

### 🎬 What Happens After "Commit Changes":

**Immediately (0-10 seconds):**
- GitHub creates the workflow file
- You'll be redirected back to the Actions tab
- You'll see a new workflow run appear (with a yellow circle 🟡)

**Building Phase (1-3 minutes):**
- The yellow circle 🟡 means it's building your site

- You'll see steps like "Setup Pages", "Upload artifact", "Deploy"

**Success! (After 2-3 minutes):**
- Yellow circle 🟡 turns to green checkmark ✅
- Your site is now LIVE and accessible!

### 📋 What to Do Next:

**Step 1: Check Build Status**
- Stay on the "Actions" tab
- Watch for the green checkmark ✅
- If you see red X ❌, something went wrong (rare)

**Step 2: Get Your Live Link**
- Go back to "Settings" → "Pages"
- At the top, you'll see: **"Your site is published at https://bhavya-org.github.io/attendance-tracker"**

### 🎯 Timeline:
